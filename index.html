            Greetings! Quick fact about me is that Washington is the sixth state that I've lived in. Five out of six were over the last 10 years of my life. 
            I lived in Senatobia, MS my first two years of college, then moved to Atlanta, GA for my last two (actually 3) years of college. 
            I relocated to Fargo, ND for my first adult job and stayed there two and a half years. I then moved to Dallas, TX for my husband's job, where I stayed for one year. Finally, here I am in Seattle (really Bothell), where I've resided since March.  
            I have things that I love and strongly dislike about all of the places I've lived, and they've all played a crucial part in who I am today. 
             <br>
             <br>
            I'm a basketball junkie. I love to have debates about basketball with absolutely anyone, including my manager. Organized basketball was a major part of my life.
            I was on a basketball team from age 8 all the way through collegiate athletics, ending at age 21. This is also a huge part as to why I'm in this bootcamp. 
            I also LOVE the play Hamilton. I've seen it twice, once in London and once in San Francisco. I'm planning to see it at least 5 more times. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I like to cook lasagna and make taco salad. Not at the same time though. Actually, I have not tried that combination but I'll assume it's not a good fit. 
            </p>
